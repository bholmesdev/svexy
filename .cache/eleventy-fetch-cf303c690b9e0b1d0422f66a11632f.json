[{"date":"2005-10-25","explanation":"Thousands of years after a star exploded, its expanding remnant still glows brightly across the spectrum.  Such is the case with N132D, a supernova remnant located in the neighboring Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) galaxy.  The expanding shell from this explosion now spans 80 light-years and has swept up about 600 Suns worth of mass.  N132D was imaged recently in optical light and in great detail with the Hubble Space Telescope.  The Hubble image was then combined with a position coincident detailed image in X-ray light taken by the Chandra X-ray Observatory.  The combination, shown above in representative colors, shows a nearly spherical expanding shockwave highlighted by pink emission from hydrogen gas and purple emission from oxygen gas.  A dense field of unrelated stars also from the LMC populates the image.  Studying the image gives an opportunity to study material once hidden deep inside a star.  N132D spans about 150 light years and lies about 160,000 light years away toward the constellation of Dorado.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0510/n132d_heritage_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Supernova Remnant N132D in Optical and X Rays","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0510/n132d_heritage.jpg"},{"copyright":"Eric ColesMartin Pugh","date":"2017-10-18","explanation":"Blue dust clouds and young, energetic stars inhabit this telescopic vista, less than 500 light-years away toward the northern boundary of Corona Australis, the Southern Crown. The dust clouds effectively block light from more distant background stars in the Milky Way. But the striking complex of reflection nebulas cataloged as NGC 6726, 6727, and IC 4812 produce a characteristic blue color as light from the region's bright blue stars is reflected by the cosmic dust. The dust also obscures from view stars still in the process of formation. At the left, smaller yellowish nebula NGC 6729 bends around young variable star R Coronae Australis. Just below it, glowing arcs and loops shocked by outflows from embedded newborn stars are identified as Herbig-Haro objects. On the sky this field of view spans about one degree, corresponding to almost nine light-years at the estimated distance of the nearby star forming region.

As a result, two celestial wonders easily visible for southern hemisphere skygazers are known as the Clouds of Magellan. These cosmic clouds are now understood to be dwarf irregular galaxies, satellites of our larger spiral Milky Way Galaxy. The Small Magellanic Cloud pictured above actually spans 15,000 light-years or so and contains several hundred million stars. About 210,000 light-years distant in the constellation Tucana, it is the fourth closest of the Milky Way's known satellite galaxies, after the Canis Major and Sagittarius Dwarf galaxies and the Large Magellanic Cloud. This gorgeous view also includes two foreground globular star clusters NGC 362 (top left) and 47 Tucanae. Spectacular 47 Tucanae is a mere 13,000 light-years away and seen here to the right of the Small Magellanic Cloud.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0506/SMCHambschGendlerFull.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"The Small Cloud of Magellan","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0506/SMCHambschGendlerC44.jpg"},{"date":"2005-04-15","explanation":"A cosmic bubble of gas and dust, RCW 79 has grown to about 70 light-years in diameter, blown by the winds and radiation from hot young stars. Infrared light from the dust embedded in the nebula is tinted red in this gorgeous false-color view from the Spitzer Space Telescope. A good 17 thousand light-years away in the grand southern constellation Centaurus, the expanding nebula itself has triggered star formation as it plows into the gas and dust surrounding it. In fact, this penetrating infrared picture reveals groups of new stars as yellowish points scattered along the bubble's edge. One remarkable group still lies within its own natal bubble at about 7 o'clock (lower left), while another can be seen near the upper gap at about 3 o'clock (right) from the bubble's center.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0504/rcw79_spitzer_medf.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"RCW 79: Stars in a Bubble","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0504/rcw79_spitzer_medc80.jpg"},{"copyright":"Vincent Brady","date":"2015-05-18","explanation":"It was one of the quietest nights of aurora in weeks.

It is Proxima Centauri, the nearest member of the Alpha Centauri triple star system.  Light takes only 4.22 years to reach us from Proxima Centauri.  This small red star, captured in the center of the above image,  is so faint that it was only discovered in 1915 and is only visible through a telescope.  Stars of all types from our Milky Way Galaxy are visible in the background.  The brightest star in the Alpha Centauri system is quite similar to our Sun, has been known as long as recorded history, and is the third brightest star in the night sky.  The Alpha Centauri system is primarily visible from Earth's Southern Hemisphere.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0512/proximacen1_aao_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Proxima Centauri: The Closest Star","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0512/proximacen1_aao.jpg"},{"copyright":"Ken Crawford","date":"2015-10-17","explanation":"One of the brightest galaxies in planet Earth's sky is similar in size to our Milky Way Galaxy: big, beautiful M81. The grand spiral galaxy can be found toward the northern constellation of the Great Bear (Ursa Major). This superbly detailed image reveals M81's bright yellow nucleus, blue spiral arms, tell tale pinkish star forming regions, and sweeping cosmic dust lanes with a scale comparable to the Milky Way. Hinting at a disorderly past, a remarkable dust lane actually runs straight through the disk, to the left of the galactic center, contrary to M81's other prominent spiral features. The errant dust lane may be the lingering result of a close encounter between between M81 and its smaller companion galaxy, M82. Scrutiny of variable stars in M81 has yielded one of the best determined distances for an external galaxy -- 11.8 million light-years. M81's dwarf companion galaxy Holmberg IX can be seen just above the large spiral.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1510/M81crawford2048_fh.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Bright Spiral Galaxy M81","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1510/M81crawford1024_fh.jpg"},{"copyright":"MWV Observatory","date":"2013-05-11","explanation":"This week the shadow of the New Moon fell on planet Earth, crossing Queensland's Cape York in northern Australia ... for the second time in six months. On the morning of May 10, the Moon's apparent size was too small to completely cover the Sun though, revealing a \"ring of fire\" along the central path of the annular solar eclipse. Near mid-eclipse from Coen, Australia, a webcast team captured this telescopic snapshot of the annular phase. Taken with a hydrogen-alpha filter, the dramatic image finds the Moon's silhouette just within the solar disk, and the limb of the active Sun spiked with solar prominences. Still, after hosting back-to-back solar eclipses, northern Australia will miss the next and final solar eclipse of 2013. This November, a rare hybrid eclipse will track across the North Atlantic and equatorial Africa.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1305/ASE_McCarty3-3.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Cape York Annular Eclipse","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1305/ASE_McCarty3-3sc900.jpg"},{"date":"2001-10-19","explanation":"This mosaic of x-ray images cuts a swath across the photogenic Rosette Nebula, a stellar nursery 5,000 light-years from Earth in the constellation Monoceros, the Unicorn. Constructed from data recorded by the orbiting Chandra X-ray Observatory, the mosaic spans less than 100 light-years and is color coded to show low energies in red and high energy x-rays in blue. At the upper right is the young star cluster NGC 2244, central to the Rosette Nebula itself. The hot outer layers of the massive stars are seen to be copious sources of x-rays, but a diffuse x-ray glow also pervades this cluster of newborn stars. Since these stars are so young (less than few million years old!) the diffuse x-ray emission is thought to be powered by energetic, colliding stellar winds rather than remnants of supernovae explosions, a final act in the life cycle of a massive star. Moving away from the center, south and east across the nebula (upper right to lower left), the hot, blustery environment gives way to dense molecular gas, absorbing low energy x-rays while revealing the penetrating high energy x-rays from embedded stars.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0110/xrayrose_cxo_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"X-Ray Stars and Winds in the Rosette Nebula","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0110/xrayrose_cxo.jpg"},{"date":"1999-10-23","explanation":"While searching the skies above 18th century France for comets, astronomer Charles Messier diligently recorded this object as number 27 on his list of things which are definitely not comets. So what is it? Well, 20th century astronomers would classify it as a Planetary Nebula ... but it's not a planet either, even though it may appear round and planet-like in a small telescope. Messier 27 (M27) is now known to be an excellent example of a gaseous emission nebula created as a sun-like star runs out of nuclear fuel in its core. The nebula forms as the star's outer layers are expelled into space, with a visible glow generated by atoms excited by the dying star's intense but invisible ultraviolet light. Known by the popular name of the \"Dumbbell Nebula\", the beautifully symmetric interstellar gas cloud is about 1,200 light-years away in the constellation Vulpecula. This gorgeous synthetic color picture of M27 was produced during testing of one of the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescopes.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9810/m27_vlt_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"M27: Not A Comet","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9810/m27_vlt.jpg"}]
